This is example 5 for the EnKF-C package. It is equivalent to example 1 except
that the SST observations are split into SST and SST2 observation types. The
benefits include getting separate innovation statistics for each observation type
and ability to monitor the effect of new observations on the innovations of the
old ones.

A similar outcome can often be achieved with the option
"--no-superobing-across-instruments" in PREP.

Another possible setting of this example is to add "STATSONLY = 1" to the
section for SST2 in obstypes.prm. In this case the Windsat observations will not
be assimilated, but used for observation statistics only.

PREREQUISITES

Set up example 1 as described in ../1/README.

TESTING ENKF

To assimilate with the EnKF, run "make enkf".
The analysed ensemble members will be of the form 
ensemble_6565/mem<num>_<var>.nc.analysis, where <num> is the member id, between
001 and 096, and <var> is one of the state variables: eta_t, temp, salt, u or v.

TESTING ENOI

To assimilate with the EnOI, run "make enoi". The analysis will be of the form
background/bg_<var>.nc.analysis.
